How to use the application?  


The top left corner contains 3 icons. Clicking the home icon allows the user to go back to the main application. Clicking the question mark icon will show instructions of how the application works. The pencil icon allows the user to toggle between edit and solve mode.  


In edit mode, the user can add new problems first by typing out a valid arithmetic expression and then either click the "+" icon or pressing enter. When the user adds a new problem, a new input box will appear with the added problem and its solution. The new input box allows the user to edit an added problem by first modifying the problem and then either click the circular arrow icon on the right or press enter. The user can delete any problem by clicking the "x" icon on the left. The user can also clear the list of problems by clicking the broom icon at the bottom.  


In solve mode, the user provides an answer to each problem in the input box below the respective problem. To check the answers and the score, the user can click the checklist icon at bottom, which will prompt an alert detailing which answers are correct along with the percentage score.
